## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```
$ npm install dush-methods --save
```

or install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```
$ yarn add dush-methods
```

## Usage
> For more use-cases see the [tests](test.js)

```js
const dushMethods = require('dush-methods')
```

## API

### [methods()](index.js#L32)
> Plugin for [dush][], [minibase][], [base][] and anything based on them. It adds `.define` and `.delegate` methods on the `app` instance.

* `returns` **{Function}**: a plugin function that should be passed to `.use` method  

**Example**

```js
const dush = require('dush')
const methods = require('dush-methods')

const app = dush()
app.use(methods())

console.log(app.define) // => function
console.log(app.delegate) // => function
```

### [.define](index.js#L69)
> Add non-enumerable `prop` with a `value`. It also emits a `define` event.

**Params**

* `prop` **{String}**: a name of the property    
* `value` **{any}**: any type of value    
* `returns` **{Object}**: instance for chaining  

**Example**

```js
app.define('foo', 123)
console.log(app.foo) // => 123

app.on('define', (key, value) => {
  console.log('key:', key) // => 'key: foo'
  console.log('value:', value) // => 'value: 123'
})

// or inside plugin
app.use((app) => {
  app.define('hello', (place) => console.log(`Hello ${place}!`))
})

app.hello('world') // => 'Hello world!'
```

### [.delegate](index.js#L105)
> Calls the `.define` method for each property on `props` object. It also emits `delegate` event.

**Params**

* `props` **{Object}**: an object of properties    
* `returns` **{Object}**: instance for chaining  

**Example**

```js
// called two times
app.on('define', (key, value) => {
  console.log(key) // => `foo`, then `qux`
  console.log(value) // => `bar`, then `123`
})

// called one time
app.on('delegate', (props) => {
  console.log('props:', props) // => { foo: 'bar', qux: 123 }
})

app.delegate({
  foo: 'bar',
  qux: 123
})
```

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue][open-issue-url].  
Please read the [contributing guidelines][contributing-url] for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io][codementor-url] too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md][changelogmd-url] and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
